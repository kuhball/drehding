# Exhibition
Collection of ideas for installations and performances based on the project.

### Handheld
- Big room or forest, many turning devices all over the place, some maybe hidden in the trees or dark corners. General lightning subdued up to dark.
- Everyone who enters gets a handheld device, which is essentially a strobo
- When pressing the trigger, a random flash sequence starts that continues as long as the trigger is pressed
- It can be pointed at any turning object, creating an effect, the exact effect depends on object and flash sequence
- Visitors can combine their sequences on an object, creating new effects
- Every time the trigger is released and pressed again, a new random sequence starts

Remarks on this:
- all motors must turn with same speed and must be of same type
- sending the current hall sensor tick over the air might be to slow
	- if it is, then we must use a cable based handheld version
	- then every station would have their own 1-3 handheld devices
