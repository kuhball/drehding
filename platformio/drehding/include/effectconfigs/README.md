# Effect configs
A collection of configuration files that define effect sequences for the project. Allows for easy switching between different effect configurations.

To select one, include it in the `main.cpp` with

```cpp
#include "effectconfigs/example.h" 
```

## How to make your own
See [example.h](example.h) for a detailed example. Then simply copy the file and adapt to your needs.
